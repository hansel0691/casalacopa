            The house is located on Calle 40 # 125 e / 1st and 3rd Avenue Miramar, a nice clean area of Havana; the best way to get to it to reach it for tourist trips is directly across from the Malecon via West, continuing along 5th Avenue to 40th Street Miramar, Another option is the "hop on - hop off" tour bus of Havana flowing just two blocks and covers most major tourist sites of the city. You can also access through private taxi service available to home's customers.
